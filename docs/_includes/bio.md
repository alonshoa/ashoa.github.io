- <h3>software engineer \ researcher - NICE SYSTEMS</h3>
Jul 2015 - Dec 2020 

At NICE, I wore many hats from 2015 to 2020. I started by automating testing for speech engines and streamlined the process of accepting human-transcribed speech.  Moving to the Recording Team, I integrated a new chat system and built a secure HTML5 player.  Later, as a researcher (from 2018), I explored fascinating areas like speaker authentication. This involved using i-vectors, a technique where we break down the audio using a special kind of analysis (Factor Analysis) to create unique identifiers, almost like fingerprints, for each voice.  With i-vectors, we explored ways to identify speakers and even prevent fraud using voice biometrics.  My work on a federated learning project, which allows secure model training without sharing data, even earned me an Impact Award in 2020!

- <h3>Software Engineer - ACLP</h3>
Oct 2013 - Jul  2015

During my time as a Software Engineer at Afeka Center for Language Processing (ACLP) from 2013 to 2015, I gained experience in various speech processing tools and user interface design. I built a searchable database application for transcribed speech using C# and ASP.net, leveraging Elasticsearch for efficient search. I also played a key role in integrating open-source diarization systems for a research project on speaker identification, and developed a speech interface for a speech-to-speech question answering system utilizing Kaldi for speech recognition and Microsoft Text-to-Speech for spoken responses
