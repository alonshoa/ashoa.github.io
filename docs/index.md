# Alon Shoa



Hello! And thanks for stopping by.
I'm Alon. For the last 10 years, I've been working in software development, 
mostly in the domains of speech processing and ML. And for the last 3 years, I've combined my work with XR (VR/AR).


I'm passionate about exploring new technologies and pioneering innovative approaches in software development. 
Over the past decade, I've dedicated myself to advancing the fields of speech processing and machine learning, 
constantly seeking out opportunities to push the boundaries of what's possible. In the last three years, 
I've been particularly excited to blend my expertise with extended reality (XR) technologies, including virtual and augmented reality, 
opening up new realms of possibility for immersive experiences.

<!-- I love to work with new technology and develop a new type of thinking over the field of writing software.
over the last years, scince the raise of LLM's I've worked on LLMs for some different projects.
training localy or remotely, design of virtual characters, and creating uneqe experiaces using virtual characters in VR \ AR setups. -->
